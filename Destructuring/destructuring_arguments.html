    // Destructuring allows you to extract data from, AARAYS, OBJECTS, MAPS, and SETS into their own variable.

    const person = {
        first: 'Bryan',
        last: 'Summers',
        country: 'Aust',
        city: 'Perth'
    };

    // const first = person.first;
    // const last = person.last;

    // Or, with destructuring:

    const { first, last } = person;

    console.log(first, last);

    /*
        - The {} is not a block; in this case it is the destructuring syntax
        - The code above gives you a variable called 'first', a 'variable' called last, and takes the values from
        the person object
    */

    // You can use destructuring with deeper nested data too:

    const person2 = {
        first: 'Bryan',
        last: 'Summers',
        location: {
            country: 'Aust',
            city: 'Perth'
        },
        links: {
            social: {
                twitter: 'twitter.com/bryan',
                facebook: 'facebook.com/bryan'
            }
        }
    };

    const { country, city } = person2.location; // creates a variable for country and one for city

    console.log(country, city);


    /* Sometimes the data from an API comes back with some odd property names, which you might not want to use.
       So you can RENAME the properties as you destructure them:
    */

    const { twitter: tweetSphere, facebook: fagBook } = person2.links.social;

    console.log(tweetSphere, fagBook);
