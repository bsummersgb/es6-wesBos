// The old way of declaring default arguments:
    function calculateBill(total, tax, tip) {
        if (tax === undefined) {
            tax = 0.13;
        }
        // or...
        tip = tip || 0.15 // terse but hard to read code

        return total + (total * tax) + (total * tip);
    }


// The new way:

    function calculateBill2(total, tax = 0.13, tip = 0.15) {
        return total + (total * tax) + (total * tip);
    }

    const totalBill = calculateBill(100);
    console.log(totalBill);

    /* The tax will never change, but the tip amount may change. Because of the order of the arguments, 
    you would explicitly pass undefined as the default argument and then alter the tip amount. This is because
    the default argument code tax = 0.13 is actually the same as tax = tax || 0.13, 
    i.e. it's checking if someone is passing undefined against the default value of 0.13

    const totalBillBetterTip = calculateBill(100, undefined, 0.25)
    console.log(totalBillBetterTip);
